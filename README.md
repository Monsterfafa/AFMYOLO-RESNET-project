# AFM YOLO-RESNET Project

This project implements a YOLO-RESNET model for detecting defects in AFM images. The model is designed to detect small objects and features in AFM images.

## Description

This repository contains the code for the AFM YOLO-RESNET project. The primary goal of this project is to enhance defect detection in AFM images using a combination of YOLO and RESNET architectures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV

### Installation
 Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Monsterfafa/AFM-YOLO-RESNET-project.git
   
Dataset and Trained Weights
Please note that the AFM image dataset and the trained weights are not included in this repository. They are stored in a Box folder owned by me (ISU) and can be accessed upon request.

The dataset and trained weights are available upon request at the following link:
